# van-der-Waerden-number-computation
An implementation of the pseudocode in Tanbir Ahmed's "Some More Van der Waerden Numbers" paper.

# How to run
1. compile main.cpp with a C++ compiler of your choice
2. run it with command line arguments being $k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_{r}$ seperated by a spaces between each $k_i$
3. the program will output the computed van der Waerden number
